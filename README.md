# Get Up
## A special alarm clock app for my entry in the 2019 congressional app challenge.

### What does this app do?
This app allows users to create an alarm and set the amount of times it should go off. So if you wake up and turn off your alarm, another will be ready to go off. It can also then give the user a brain teaser to try and wake them up.

### Questions
- How did I hear about the congressional app challenge?
  - I am an officer in my school's coding club and while the teacher was just going over different STEM events she mentioned the app challenge and I looked at it and went "Why not give it a try?"
- What is the app written in?
  - The app was made in JavaScript using Facebook's React Native framework.
- Why did you use React Native?
  - I chose React Native because of it's ability to allow me to write the code once and have it be compiled to run on both Android and iOS. I also have a lot of JavaScript experience and didn't have the time to learn how to make an Android app in Java or Kotlin, or how to make an iOS app in Swift or Objective-C.
- Why is it only available for Android?
  - I only have access to a Windows PC so I could only compile for Android. I also already had a Google Play Store developer license.
